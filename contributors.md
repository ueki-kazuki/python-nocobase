## Contribution Process

To contribute to this project, follow these steps:

### 1. Fork the Repository

Click the "Fork" button on the top right corner of the repository's page on GitHub. This will create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

### 2. Create a Branch

Clone your forked repository to your local machine, then create a new branch for your contribution. Name your branch in a descriptive manner that reflects the purpose of your contribution.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-nocobase.git
cd python-nocobase
git checkout -b feature/your-feature
```

### 3. Work on Your Contribution

Now you can start working on your contribution. Be sure to follow the coding guidelines (mentioned below) and implement your changes or new features.

### 4. Test Your Code

Thoroughly test your code to ensure it works as expected. Make sure to write unit tests, if applicable. Your contribution should not introduce new bugs or regressions.

### 5. Commit Your Changes

Once you are satisfied with your work, commit your changes. Be sure to write clear and descriptive commit messages.

```bash
git add .

When your code is ready for review, push your changes to your forked repository, and then open a Pull Request (PR) to the main repository's `main` branch. In your PR description, provide a clear and detailed explanation of your contribution, including what the change does and why it is needed.

Our team will review your PR, provide feedback, and merge it when it meets our quality and functionality standards.
